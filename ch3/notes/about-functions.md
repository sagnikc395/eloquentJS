## Functions:

- They are the bread and butter of Javascript Programming.
- Gives us a way to structure larger programs , to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms and to isolate these subprograms from each other.

- Function have a set of parametrs (here x) and a body, which contains the statements that are to be executed when the function is called. The function body of a function craeted this way must always be wrapped in braces, even when it consists of only a single statement.

- Function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all.

- A return stmt determines the value the function returns. When control comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value to the code that called the function.
- A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return undefined.
